# Debugging

This lesson demonstrates how to utilize the Visual Studio Code extension to debug projects. Please setup the extension first if you haven't already, following the instructions in the [Install tutorial](./install.md).


1. Set up your project according to the instructions in the [Basic use tutorial](./HowtoUse.md).
2. Run **`ERS:Execute the OpenOcd Server command`**. Once the OpenOcd server detects  your board, you need to run a gdb server. To do this, go to the Activity Bar on the left and click the **Run and Debug (Ctrl + Shift + D)** button. A new window should pop up where you need to choose the **`ESP32C3_DEBUG`** option as shown below:
